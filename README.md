Module 4 analysis with Maria 

### District Summary:
 
After removing the contested scores for ninth grade students, the district summary information was compared with the previous analysis. While the average scores in math and reading were not affected by grade removal, the overall passing math and reading scores dropped considerably. The percent of district students passing math dropped from 75% to 53%, and the percent of district students passing reading dropped from 86% to 61%. This reduced the overall percent of students passing both reading and math from 65% to 46%. This subsequent analysis reveals that when ninth grade scores are removed, less than half of district students pass both subjects. 

### School Summary:

After ninth grade scores were removed, all schools showed a decrease in the number and percentage of students who passed math, reading, and in both subjects overall. Cabrera High School was the #1 school for the district with a 91.3% pass rate in both subjects; but after ninth grade scores were removed, Cabrera’s overall pass rate decreased to 65.1%, decreasing its rank to #3 in the district.  Other school rankings were also disturbed - Rodriguez High School was the lowest ranked district school (#15 out of 15 schools) but Ford High School is now ranked lowest after ninth grade scores were removed. 

### Thomas High School Comparison:

Prior to removal of grades, Thomas High School was in the three highest ranked schools in the district with an overall passing rate of 90.9% (#2 out of 15 schools). However, the removal of grades resulted in Thomas High School slipping from a #2 to a #4 ranking, surpassed by Griffin and Wilson High Schools and is no longer in the top three high schools. The new overall pass rate for Thomas High School is 65.1%. 

### Scores by Grade:

Since the ninth grade scores were the only ones removed, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade scores were not affected when calculated by grade level. However, ninth graders now show a pass rate of 0% in both subjects. 

### Scores by School Spending:

When comparing scores based on school spending, the removal of ninth grade scores affects the average math and average reading scores only minimally (by less than 1%). This is likely due to the power of the data, and the removal of roughly 1/4th of the grades does not have a significant affect on the mean. However, it does have a significant affect on the individual subject and overall passing rates; all spending ranges show a significant decrease in pass rate after ninth grade score removal by approximately the same amount. What doesn’t really make sense from an administrative standpoint is that the schools with less funding per student typically fared better, both before and after grade removal. Typically, it is expected that there is a direct relationship between funding levels and performance, yet here it is an inverse relationship. 

### Scores by School Size:

A similar relationship was found when looking at scores by school size after grade removal. The change in average scores was not significant, but the change in passing rates was dramatically reduced. All size schools were reduced in pass rate by the same amount (approx. 30% reduction).

### Scores by School Type:

Lastly, scores by school type also reveal the a similar pattern - average scores were not affected significantly, yet overall passing rates declined considerably. However, district schools compared to charter schools had a more significant reduction in overall passing rate (29.6% reduction versus 27.7% reduction).
